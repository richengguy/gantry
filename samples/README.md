# Service Definition Samples

The various samples can be built using the `./scripts/build-sample` script.  See
the `_build.sh` file in each sample to see how the sample is built.  This runs
with two environment variables that are defined by `build-sample`:

* `SAMPLE_FOLDER` - Path to the current sample folder location.
* `OUTPUT_FOLDER` - Path to the gantry build output location.
